    "# SUBSETTING PRACTICE WITH ISLANDS\n",

    "\n",
    "## Readme\n",
    "This exercise is very similar to the practice on the `Nile` dataset. Here, we're using another built-in dataset, `islands`. Instead of `time`, you need to use `names` to analyze the content of `islands`, and instead of a line plot, you will draw a dot plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "Find out what `islands` contains and what its structure is. Take a look at `example(islands)` too. Complete the following 10 problems in this notebook. Submit the completed file in Canvas for bonus points.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add short comments in code cells to explain your output.\n",
    "- Answer questions in the provided text blocks where specified.\n",
    "- Save the notebook as `islands_vector.ipynb`.\n",
