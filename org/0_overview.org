IMRaD is the framework for all scientific publications:
#+begin_quote
- Introduction (research question - what you want to find out)
- Method (how you want to do it)
- Results (what you found out)
- Discussion (what it means)

([[https://youtu.be/dip7UwZ3wUM][Video: Research Writing with IMRaD]])

#+attr_html: :width 500px
[[../img/1_datacamp.png]]
#+begin_quote

- Access for you is free (academic alliance until end of the
  term[fn:4])
- Most if not all term assignments are DataCamp assignments
- Assignments are drawn from several courses:
  1. Understanding data science (bonus, pre-term)
  2. Introduction to R
  3. Intermediate R
  4. Explorative Data Analysis with R
  5. Python for R Users
- Complete them on time to get full points (late submission: 50%)
- DataCamp certificates can support your resume ([[https://www.linkedin.com/in/birkenkrahe/][LinkedIn example)]]

* Good-bye Emacs + ESS + Org-mode, Hello (again), Jupyter + Datalab!

- You will see me use Emacs, ESS and the Org-mode extension.

- You will learn interactive computing and literate programming.

- You will use the Datalab platform for code-along and assignments.

- Emacs vs. DataLab
  | Feature | Emacs+ESS+Org        | Datalab (DataCamp)    |
  |---------+----------------------+-----------------------|
  | Type    | Free, extensible     | Proprietary, cloud    |
  | Env     | Local/offline        | Web, needs internet   |
  | Langs   | R, Julia, SAS, + 45  | Mostly R, Python, SQL |
  | Repro   | Literate, Org export | Hosted notebooks      |
  | Custom  | Infinite via Lisp    | Limited features      |
  | Curve   | Steep, powerful      | Easy, beginner focus  |
  | Collab  | Git, plain text      | Built-in sharing      |
  | Cost    | Free (GPL)           | Subscription          |
  | Users   | Researchers, power   | Students, learners    |
  | AI      | Not built-in         | Free to use           |

* What is literate programming?
#+attr_html: :width 700px
[[../img/1_litprog.png]]

Even though we're not using Emacs + Org-mode + RSS, Datalab, which is
based on Jupyter notebooks, still enables and encourages "literate
programming".

This means that you use interactive (REPL) computing to speed things
up but you don't stop documenting your process and your progress.

#+begin_quote
Paper: "[[https://www.mdpi.com/2673-6470/3/3/15][Teaching Data Science with Literate Programming Tools]]" (2023)

- Common practice among data scientists
- /Paradigm/ behind interactive computing notebooks
- Useful when learning any programming language
  
#+end_quote
* Using GitHub

- GitHub is the top software development platform now owned (but not
  ruined yet) by Microsoft (however: check the documentation).

- The term 'Git' refers to the version control software of the same
  name. You can also use it as a central document repository.

- All course materials (data/src/org/pdf/img) are on GitHub at
  [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ds1][github.com/birkenkrahe/ds1]]. You can watch/fork this repository.

- You can use GitHub yourself to synchronize content between different
  computers, e.g. the lab and your PC.

- Recommended: the [[https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world][Hello World exercise]] at GitHub. This teaches you
  the typical software project development workflow.

- You can get access to GitHub's AI-assistant CoPilot, which also runs
  in VSCode and Jetbrains, if you submit your student credentials (ask
  Matthew about the excruciating details).

* Using Linux
#+attr_html: :width 600px:
[[../img/penguins.jpg]]

Linux is the world's most used operating system (the software between
you and your computer, or your phone) based on 1970s Unix developed by
Linus Torvalds (who also wrote the Git version control software).

For the past year, I've experimented with providing a Linux VM to
students via IT. However, they never sorted out access outside of Lyon
104, and Window's Remote Desktop Control is a little nightmarish.

You have two practical entry points to Linux:

1) At no cost, and almost no effort, use Google Cloud Shell
   (https://ide.cloud.google.com).
   
2) If you're on Windows, install WSL (Windows Subshell Linux) on the
   Power Shell with =wsl --install=.

3) If you're on a Mac, don't worry about it for now, you've got an OS
   that's already close enough to Linux (Unix-based MacOS).

4) If you're on a Mac or on Windows, consider switching to Linux for
   good. There's no downside that I can think of and many upsides.

You can ask me or one of the other students (e.g. Matthew) for help.

* Tests (multiple-choice)
#+attr_html: :width 600px
[[../img/1_entry_quiz.png]]

#+begin_quote
- Tests have to be completed online, are timed, and have a deadline;
  after the deadline, you can play them an unlimited number of times
- There will be a revision quiz on Canvas every week, consisting of
  several multiple choice, matching and true/false questions.
- A subset of the test questions will form the final exam (25% of your
  final grade) - the exam is optional for you to improve your grade.
#+end_quote

* First home assignments
#+attr_html: :width 500px
[[../img/home.jpg]]

- Register with DataCamp now if you haven't done it yet ([[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/3676/pages/course-resources][links]]).
- Complete chapter 1 of the course "Understanding Data Science",
  [[https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/understanding-data-science][Introduction to data science]] on the DataCamp platform (by Friday).
- Read the [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/3676/assignments/49570][home assignment instructions]] carefully, especially my
  remarks on how to work through online lessons and late submissions.

* Next: Infrastructure Exercise

- First steps in DataLab.

* Footnotes

[fn:1]There are good reasons to choose R over Python as a first
language for data science students. Unfortunately, the dominance of
the "Tidyverse" ideology negates this slight advantage. Still, for
visualization and statistical analysis, R is still superior, IMHO.

[fn:2]Or in another language: Julia, bash, or data analysis apps like
PowerBi or Tableau come to mind - you can find examples at [[https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial][DataCamp]].

[fn:3]If you do use the same project topic in more than one of my
courses, talk to me to make sure that the projects differ
sufficiently.

[fn:4]If you wish to use DataCamp beyond the end of the term, contact
me and I can add you to next term's workspace.

[fn:5]These video lectures follow the GitHub scripts and practice
files, and are motivated by pp. 1-55 of the book by Tuckfield (2023).
