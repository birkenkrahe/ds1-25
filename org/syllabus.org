* Objectives

Data science is concerned with getting data to work for us, to give us
its (presumed) hidden treasures. Data science has been called "the
sexiest job of the 21st century". Even if you don't want to become a
professonial data scientist, it's helpful to master the basic concepts
if you want to succeed in today's data-driven business.

* Target audience

The course is for anyone who is interested in becoming more data
literate in their own field of interest - be it languages, theatre,
biology, psychology or exercise science - and growing their personal
skill stack. Visualization of data-driven insights and improved
productivity when working with data and media is a concern for any
professional.

* Student Learning Outcomes

Students who complete "Introduction to data science" (DSC 105) will be
able to:

- Learn computer and data science principles by playing with data
- Acquire basic programming skills using Python, R, SQL, and bash
- Apply literate programming principles by working with Emacs/Org-mode
- Use infrastructure including command line, Jupyter notebooks, GitHub
- Understand the relationship of humans, machines, and data
- Develop their critical thinking skills
- Learn how to effectively use AI coding assistants like Copilot, Code
  Interpreter (ChatGPT)
- Understand the impact of, and can code in R, Python, SQL, bash
- Know how to effectively present assignment and project results

Students, who complete DSC 105 will have fulfilled the prerequisites
for DSC 205, Introduction to advanced data science, which focuses on
advanced practices in data exploration, visualization, and integration
with databases and other languages (such as C++, SQL) through R and
Python packages and APIs.

* Course prerequisites

Formal prerequisites: Introduction to Programming (either CSC100 or
CSC115 or CSC109, and MTH101 (College Algebra).

Otherwise no prior knowledge required. Some knowledge of, and
experience with computers and/or programming is useful but not
critical. Curiosity is essential. You will gain data literacy skills
by taking this course. The course will prepare you for further studies
in computer and data science, or in other disciplines that use modern
computing, i.e. every discipline, from accounting to zoology).

* A note on using AI to write code for you or debug your code

[[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/fall25/UsingAItoCode.org][See full PDF on GitHub (Fall 2025 update).]]

Summary:

1. Only use AI if you don't (deeply) care about the result, if you
   don't depend on it, and if you have ample time to waste.

2. AI lies unpredictably, and worse, it makes you forget stuff you
   already knew. It's an unreliable helper without understanding.

3. There is little solid research into the human-AI interaction and
   its benefits and dangers - because of the pace of development but
   also because of the reigning commercial interests.

4. The value of AI increases somewhat when you use it for topics and
   on issues that you are already an expert in. Then you can
   second-guess and monitor the results much better. It still boils
   down to a waste of time whenever the issues are complex.

I got to these insights through my own experience as a teacher of
computer and data science, as someone who hears a lot from other
faculty what they're experiencing, and as a coder.
